## Why This Decision Matters

Your website is often the first impression potential customers have of your business. A bad website costs you credibility and customers. A good website generates leads and revenue.

The person or team you hire to build it will determine which outcome you get.

I've seen small businesses waste $5,000-15,000 on websites that don't work, don't convert, and don't last. I've also seen businesses invest $2,500 in websites that generate consistent leads for years.

The difference? Who they hired.

This guide will help you make the right choice.

## The Three Types of Web Developers

### 1. Freelance Developers

**What they are:** Individual developers working independently.

**Pros:**
- Usually lower cost
- Direct communication (no middlemen)
- Often more flexible
- Personal accountability

**Cons:**
- May disappear (one person, one risk)
- Limited capacity
- Might lack certain skills
- No team for complex projects

**Best for:** Small business websites, simple projects, tight budgets

**Typical cost:** $500-5,000

### 2. Web Development Agencies

**What they are:** Companies with multiple developers, designers, project managers.

**Pros:**
- Team redundancy (if someone leaves, others continue)
- Broader skill sets
- More capacity for large projects
- Established processes

**Cons:**
- Higher overhead = higher prices
- Communication through project managers
- Your project may not be their priority
- Cookie-cutter approaches common

**Best for:** Large enterprise projects, complex applications, big budgets

**Typical cost:** $10,000-100,000+

### 3. Small Development Firms / Specialized Studios

**What they are:** Small teams (2-10 people) often specializing in specific niches.

**Pros:**
- Personal attention of freelancer
- Reliability of an agency
- Often deep expertise in their niche
- Reasonable pricing

**Cons:**
- May be limited to their specialty
- Smaller team than big agencies

**Best for:** Small-to-medium businesses wanting quality without enterprise pricing

**Typical cost:** $2,500-15,000

## Red Flags: Warning Signs to Watch For

### 1. No Portfolio or Vague Examples

If a developer can't show you specific examples of their work, that's a problem. Everyone starts somewhere, but you shouldn't be someone's first paying project unless the price reflects that.

**What to do:** Ask to see 3-5 recent projects similar to yours. Get URLs you can visit.

### 2. Promises of Page 1 Google Rankings

No legitimate developer guarantees search rankings. Google's algorithm is complex and constantly changing. Anyone promising guaranteed rankings is either lying or planning to use black-hat tactics that will eventually hurt you.

**What to do:** Run. Any developer making this claim doesn't understand SEO or is being dishonest.

### 3. Extremely Low Prices

If someone offers to build your website for $200-500, they're either:
- Using a template they'll barely customize
- Outsourcing to the lowest bidder overseas
- Planning to upsell you constantly
- Not planning to stick around for support

Quality web development takes time. Time costs money. Prices that seem too good to be true usually are.

**What to do:** Be skeptical of quotes significantly below market rate. Ask what's included and what's not.

### 4. No Contract or Vague Agreement

Professional developers use contracts that specify:
- Exactly what's being delivered
- Timeline and milestones
- Payment terms
- Who owns the code/design
- What happens if things go wrong

No contract = no protection for you.

**What to do:** Insist on a written agreement before any payment.

### 5. Poor Communication From the Start

If a developer takes a week to respond to your initial inquiry, imagine how communication will be during the project. The sales phase is when they should be most responsive.

**What to do:** Pay attention to response times and communication quality before hiring.

### 6. They Don't Ask About Your Business

A developer who jumps straight to talking about features without understanding your business goals isn't thinking about what you actually need. They're thinking about what's easy to build.

**What to do:** Notice if they ask about your customers, goals, and how the website fits your business strategy.

### 7. No Process or Timeline

"We'll figure it out as we go" is not a process. Professional developers have a clear workflow:
1. Discovery/planning
2. Design
3. Development
4. Review and revisions
5. Launch
6. Support

**What to do:** Ask about their process. If they can't explain it clearly, they probably don't have one.

## Green Flags: Signs You've Found a Good One

### 1. Clear, Organized Portfolio

Good developers are proud of their work and organize it for easy viewing. Look for:
- Live links (not just screenshots)
- Variety of projects
- Projects similar to what you need
- Case studies explaining the work

### 2. They Ask Smart Questions

Questions like:
- "Who are your ideal customers?"
- "What action do you want visitors to take?"
- "What's working and not working with your current site?"
- "How does your website fit into your sales process?"

These show they're thinking about your success, not just building something.

### 3. Transparent Pricing

Good developers can give you a clear quote based on your requirements. They explain what's included and what would cost extra. There shouldn't be mystery about what you're paying for.

### 4. References Available

They should be willing to connect you with past clients. If they've done good work, past clients will vouch for them.

### 5. Clear Timeline

They can tell you approximately how long the project will take and what the major milestones are. Professional developers have built enough sites to estimate accurately.

### 6. They Push Back Sometimes

A developer who agrees with everything you say isn't thinking critically. Good developers share their expertise—they'll tell you if something you want isn't a good idea and explain why.

### 7. They Talk About After Launch

Websites need maintenance, updates, and occasional fixes. Developers who only talk about building the site and not supporting it might disappear after launch.

## Questions to Ask Before Hiring

### About Their Work

1. "Can you show me 3 websites similar to what I need?"
2. "What technologies do you use and why?"
3. "How do you handle mobile responsiveness?"
4. "What's your approach to site speed optimization?"
5. "How do you handle SEO basics?"

### About the Process

1. "What does your process look like from start to finish?"
2. "How will we communicate during the project?"
3. "How many revision rounds are included?"
4. "What do you need from me to do your job well?"
5. "What's your typical timeline for a project like mine?"

### About Business Terms

1. "Who owns the website code and design when we're done?"
2. "What's your payment structure?"
3. "What happens if I need changes after launch?"
4. "Do you offer ongoing maintenance?"
5. "What if I'm not satisfied with the work?"

### About Them

1. "How long have you been doing this?"
2. "What types of businesses do you typically work with?"
3. "Can I speak with a recent client?"
4. "What's your availability for my project?"
5. "Will you personally be doing the work or outsourcing it?"

## How to Compare Quotes

When you get quotes from different developers, make sure you're comparing apples to apples.

### Create a Requirements List

Before getting quotes, document:
- Number of pages
- Features needed (contact form, blog, e-commerce, etc.)
- Design expectations (custom design vs. template)
- Content creation (are they writing copy or are you?)
- SEO requirements
- Ongoing maintenance needs

### What Should Be Included

A complete web development quote should include:
- Design (mockups/wireframes)
- Development (building the actual site)
- Content integration (adding your text and images)
- Mobile optimization
- Basic SEO setup
- Testing
- Launch
- Training (how to update your site)
- Some period of support post-launch

### Watch for Hidden Costs

Common add-ons that should be clarified upfront:
- Hosting costs (monthly/yearly)
- Domain registration
- SSL certificate
- Stock photos
- Content writing
- Additional pages beyond initial scope
- Third-party integrations
- Ongoing maintenance

## The Hiring Process

### Step 1: Define Your Needs

Before reaching out to anyone:
- List your must-have features
- Identify your target audience
- Set a realistic budget
- Determine your timeline
- Gather examples of sites you like

### Step 2: Research Candidates

Find 3-5 potential developers through:
- Referrals from other business owners
- Google searches (local terms like "web developer Houston")
- Industry directories (DesignRush, Clutch, etc.)
- LinkedIn
- Local business groups

### Step 3: Initial Contact

Reach out with a brief description of your project. A good developer will respond promptly and ask follow-up questions.

### Step 4: Discovery Calls

Have conversations with your top 2-3 choices. Pay attention to:
- Do they listen or just pitch?
- Do they ask good questions?
- Do they explain things clearly?
- Do you trust them?

### Step 5: Review Proposals

Compare quotes using the framework above. Look beyond price to value.

### Step 6: Check References

Actually call or email past clients. Ask:
- Was the project delivered on time?
- Were there unexpected costs?
- How was communication?
- Were they happy with the result?
- Would they hire this developer again?

### Step 7: Make Your Decision

Balance:
- Technical capability
- Communication quality
- Price/value
- Availability
- Trust and rapport

## Price vs. Value: What You're Really Paying For

The cheapest option is rarely the best value. Consider:

### A $500 Website Might Cost You:
- $500 upfront
- $200/year to someone else for fixes
- Lost leads due to poor design/speed
- Rebuild cost in 1-2 years when it falls apart
- **Total 3-year cost:** $1,500+ plus lost revenue

### A $3,000 Website Might Give You:
- $3,000 upfront
- Included support for a year
- Professional design that converts visitors
- Built to last 5+ years
- Generates leads consistently
- **Total 3-year cost:** $3,500 plus gained revenue

The more expensive option is often cheaper in the long run.

## After You Hire: Setting Up for Success

### Be a Good Client

Your developer will do better work if you:
- Respond promptly to questions
- Provide clear feedback
- Trust their expertise
- Pay on time
- Respect their process

### Stay Involved

Don't disappear until launch. Good projects require:
- Regular check-ins
- Feedback on designs
- Content delivery on schedule
- Testing and review

### Document Everything

Keep records of:
- All login credentials
- Hosting and domain information
- Contract and payment receipts
- Email communications
- Feature decisions and why they were made

## The Bottom Line

Hiring a web developer is a significant decision for your small business. Take your time, ask the right questions, and prioritize value over lowest price.

A good developer will:
- Understand your business goals
- Communicate clearly
- Deliver quality work on time
- Support you after launch
- Be worth every dollar you invest

A bad developer will:
- Waste your money
- Frustrate you
- Damage your business's online presence
- Leave you starting over

Choose wisely.
