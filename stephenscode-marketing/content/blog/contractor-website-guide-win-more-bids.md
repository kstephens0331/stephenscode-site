## Your Website Is Your First Impression

Before a homeowner calls you for a quote, they've already visited your website. Before a commercial client invites you to bid, they've researched your online presence.

What did they find?

If your website looks like it was built in 2010—or worse, if you don't have one at all—you've already lost ground to competitors who invested in their digital presence.

## Why Contractor Websites Are Different

Unlike retail or service businesses, contractors face unique challenges:

1. **High-value decisions** - Projects range from $10K to $500K+
2. **Long sales cycles** - Clients research for weeks or months
3. **Trust is everything** - You're asking for major investments
4. **Portfolio matters** - Clients want to see your work
5. **References get checked** - Your online reputation follows you

Your website needs to support this entire journey, not just capture a quick lead.

## The 7 Elements Every Contractor Website Needs

### 1. Professional Portfolio With Real Projects

This is non-negotiable for contractors. Your portfolio should include:

**For Each Project:**
- High-quality before and after photos
- Project scope and challenges
- Timeline and completion date
- Location (city/neighborhood, not exact address)
- Client type (residential, commercial, etc.)

**Organization:**
- Categorize by project type (kitchen remodels, additions, new construction)
- Filter by size/budget range if possible
- Feature your best 10-15 projects prominently
- Archive older projects but keep them accessible

**Photo Quality Tips:**
- Hire a photographer for major completions (worth every penny)
- Consistent lighting and angles
- Show details that demonstrate craftsmanship
- Include wide shots and close-ups

### 2. Clear Service Descriptions

Don't assume clients know what you do. Create dedicated pages for:

**Residential Services:**
- Kitchen remodeling
- Bathroom renovations
- Home additions
- Whole-home remodels
- Outdoor living spaces
- Custom home building

**Commercial Services (if applicable):**
- Tenant improvements
- Office buildouts
- Retail construction
- Restaurant buildouts
- Medical/dental office construction

Each page should explain:
- What's included in the service
- Your process from start to finish
- Typical timeline ranges
- What makes your approach different

### 3. About Page That Builds Trust

For high-value decisions, clients want to know who they're hiring:

**Include:**
- Your story and background
- Years of experience
- Licenses held (with numbers)
- Insurance coverage
- Bonding information
- Team bios for key personnel
- Professional memberships (AGC, HBA, etc.)
- Awards and recognition

**Show:**
- Real photos of you and your team
- Your office or shop (if impressive)
- Team at work on job sites
- Community involvement

### 4. Testimonials and Reviews

Social proof closes deals for contractors:

**On Your Website:**
- 5-10 detailed testimonials with full names
- Project photos alongside testimonials
- Google reviews widget embedded
- Video testimonials (extremely powerful)

**External Platforms:**
- Google Business Profile (critical)
- Houzz (for residential)
- BBB rating
- Angi/HomeAdvisor (if you use them)

**How to Get Good Testimonials:**
- Ask immediately after project completion
- Provide specific questions to guide responses
- Make it easy (send a direct link to Google)
- Follow up if they forget

### 5. Process Explanation

Clients fear the unknown. Explain exactly how working with you works:

**Typical Process Page:**
1. Initial consultation (free? how long?)
2. Design phase (who's involved?)
3. Proposal and contract
4. Permit process (you handle it?)
5. Construction phases
6. Communication during project
7. Final walkthrough
8. Warranty and follow-up

This transparency differentiates you from contractors who keep clients guessing.

### 6. Contact Options and Response Commitment

Make it easy to reach you, but set expectations:

**Contact Page Should Include:**
- Phone number (and best hours to call)
- Email address
- Contact form
- Response time commitment ("We respond within 24 hours")
- Physical address or service area
- Scheduler for consultations (if you use one)

**Pro Tip:** State your minimum project size if you have one. This pre-qualifies leads and saves everyone time.

### 7. Blog/Resources Section

Content marketing works especially well for contractors:

**Topics That Attract Clients:**
- "How Much Does a Kitchen Remodel Cost in Houston?"
- "10 Questions to Ask Before Hiring a Contractor"
- "What to Expect During a Home Addition Project"
- "Permit Requirements for [City] Renovations"
- "How to Prepare Your Home for a Remodel"

**SEO Benefits:**
- Ranks for searches clients actually make
- Demonstrates expertise before they contact you
- Provides content to share on social media
- Builds trust through education

## What Separates Winning Contractor Websites

### Amateur vs. Professional Comparison

**Amateur Website:**
- Template design from GoDaddy
- Stock photos of generic construction
- "Services" page listing everything in bullets
- Contact form only
- No portfolio or outdated photos
- "Call for quote" with no other information

**Professional Website:**
- Custom design reflecting your brand
- Professional photos of your actual work
- Detailed service pages with process info
- Phone, email, and scheduler options
- Robust portfolio with project details
- Pricing guidance and FAQ

## The Cost of an Underwhelming Website

Let's calculate the real impact:

**Assumptions:**
- Average project value: $50,000
- Close rate with good website: 30%
- Close rate with poor website: 15%
- Monthly qualified leads: 10

**Poor Website:**
- 10 leads × 15% close = 1.5 projects
- Monthly revenue: $75,000

**Professional Website:**
- 10 leads × 30% close = 3 projects
- Monthly revenue: $150,000

**Difference:** $75,000/month

**Cost of professional website:** $3,000-8,000 one-time

The math makes sense for any contractor doing serious volume.

## Portfolio Photography: Worth the Investment

This deserves its own section because it's that important.

**DIY Photography Problems:**
- Inconsistent quality
- Poor lighting
- Cluttered shots (ladders, tools, debris visible)
- Wrong time of day
- No staging

**Professional Photography Gets You:**
- Magazine-quality images
- Proper staging and lighting
- Consistent style across portfolio
- Photos you're proud to display
- Images that work on all devices

**Cost:** $200-500 per project for professional photos
**ROI:** One additional project closed pays for years of photography

## Local SEO for Contractors

Getting found online requires more than just having a website:

### Google Business Profile
- Complete every section
- Add photos regularly (weekly if possible)
- Collect and respond to reviews
- Post project updates
- List all services accurately

### Local Keywords to Target
- "General contractor [city]"

- "Kitchen remodel [neighborhood]"
- "Licensed contractor [area]"

## Common Mistakes Contractors Make Online

1. **No website at all** - "I get all my work from referrals" (until you don't)
2. **DIY website that looks DIY** - Unprofessional = untrustworthy
3. **Outdated portfolio** - Projects from 5+ years ago hurt more than help
4. **No mobile optimization** - Half your visitors are on phones
5. **Missing license/insurance info** - Raises red flags
6. **Stock photos only** - Screams "we have no real work to show"
7. **No reviews or testimonials** - Social proof is expected
8. **Contact form only** - Some clients want to call NOW
