## 🎖️ Final Note

Your biggest competitive advantage is your military background combined with 14 years of proven experience and transparent pricing. Most agencies can't offer this combination. Make sure every page of your site reinforces these three pillars:

1. **Veteran-Built** = Reliability, discipline, mission completion
2. **14 Years** = Experience, proven track record, stability
3. **Transparent Pricing** = No surprises, respect for client budget, straightforward

Focus on these, implement the critical action items first, and you'll convert significantly more visitors into clients.

**Semper Fi and good luck with the launch! 🎖️**
